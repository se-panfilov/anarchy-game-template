## B. Conformity assessment route

- **Route:** internal control (no fixed cadence of assessments unless required).

## C. Essential requirements (CRA) — evidence map

- **Secure development & change control:** see **SECURITY** (contact as listed in `./legal/SECURITY.*`), repo policies, dependency pinning/signing (short note).

## D. Risk assessment (summary)

- **Threat model / attack surface:** offline, local execution; main vectors: supply chain, integrity of bundles, update mechanism.
- **Third-party components risk:** addressed via **SBOM** + updates.
- **Residual risks / limitations:** modding at user’s risk; untrusted plugins not supported; execution on outdated browsers/OS may reduce protections.

## E. Testing & verification (summary)

- **Security testing performed:** SAST/DAST/manual review (scope + one-line result).
- **Compat/functional checks:** smoke tests on supported platforms (see **INSTRUCTIONS**).
- **Pen-test:** N/A or short note (if ever done, attach brief).

## F. SBOM

- **Location & format:** **`./sbom/` (CycloneDX JSON)**.
- **Generation:** Generated automatically at release time in CI as **CycloneDX JSON**. **Scope:** runtime dependencies of the shipped artifact based on lockfiles/bundle manifests; **excludes** dev/test/build tools and OS/platform components not bundled with the release. **If** a release bundles **native or platform-specific components**, we **may complement** the BOM with a lightweight file-level scan of the final package; otherwise the **primary runtime BOM** is the authoritative inventory. Stored under `./sbom/`; **SHA-256** recorded; retained ≥10 years; available on request.
