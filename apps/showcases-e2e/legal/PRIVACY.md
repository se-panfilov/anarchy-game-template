# Privacy Notice — showcases-e2e

**Effective date:** 11 January 2026

**Controller:** Sergei Panfilov — Contact: pnf036+anarchy@gmail.com

**Scope / Identification.** This notice applies to the **open-source project** **showcases-e2e** (hosted on or mirrored to **public code hosting platform(s)**). We do **not** operate a consumer service through this repository.

**CPRA (California):** we **do not sell or share** personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising and we do **not** process **sensitive personal information** in this repository context.

## 1. Repository Interactions

If you open issues, pull requests, or discussions, the content you submit (including your profile/handle and attachments) becomes **public** on the code-hosting platform(s) where the repository is published and is processed under the applicable platform’s privacy policy. We may process this **public** information to operate, maintain, and improve the project.
Copies of public content may also appear in mirrors, forks, caches, archival copies, package registries, or on physical media distributed by others; we do not control those third-party copies, and requests regarding them should be directed to the respective distributor or platform.

**Legal basis:** our **legitimate interests** in running the project.

**Retention:** issue/PR/discussion history is retained as part of the **public project record**. Edits/deletions are handled via the platform’s features; historical records (e.g., git history) may persist.

## 2. Communications

If you email **pnf036+anarchy@gmail.com**, we process your **email address**, **message content**, and any information you provide to respond.

**Legal basis:** our **legitimate interests** in responding to inquiries (or your **consent**, where applicable).

**Retention:** **24 months** from the date of our **last interaction in the support thread** (or ticket closure), then deletion or **irreversible anonymization**, unless longer retention is required by law or to establish, exercise, or defend **legal claims**.

## 3. Processors & Transfers

We may use service providers (e.g., email or CI hosting) as **processors**, bound by data-processing terms and our instructions. Where personal data is transferred outside your jurisdiction, we rely on recognized transfer mechanisms (e.g., **Standard Contractual Clauses**) where required by law.

## 4. Your Rights

Where applicable, you may request **access**, **rectification**, **erasure**, **restriction**, **objection**, **portability**, and **withdrawal of consent** (for processing based on consent) at **pnf036+anarchy@gmail.com**. You may also contact your local supervisory authority (e.g., the Dutch **Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens**, Brazil’s **ANPD**, Canada’s **OPC**, Australia’s **OAIC**). We may request reasonable information to **verify your identity** before acting on a request and will respond **within timelines required by applicable law**.

## 5. Security

We apply appropriate technical and organizational measures proportionate to the limited personal data we handle in connection with the repository (e.g., encrypted transport, access controls, limited retention). We do **not** use automated decision-making that produces legal or similarly significant effects.

## 6. Children

This project is intended for developers and is **not** directed to children.

## 7. Changes

We may update this notice by committing changes to the repository (the commit history indicates the effective date of each version). Material updates may also be summarized in the repository’s release notes or documentation.

## Governing Language

This **notice** is drafted in English. Translations may be provided for convenience. In markets where local-language versions are required by law for clarity and fairness, the local-language version controls to the extent required by applicable law; otherwise, the English version controls.
