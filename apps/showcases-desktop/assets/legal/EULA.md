**Support/Legal Contact:** pnf036+anarchy@gmail.com / pnf036+anarchy@gmail.com

## Identification

This EULA applies to **Anarchy Engine Showcases** (the “Software”).

Also distributed under the following technical identifiers: `showcases-desktop`.

## Defined Terms

“**Distribution Channels**” means any store, marketplace, platform, launcher, website, installer, physical media, or other mechanism used now or in the future to distribute the Software, regardless of provider.

“**Consumer**” means an individual acting wholly or mainly outside their trade, business, craft or profession.

“**Business User**” means a user who is not a Consumer.

## Severability

If any term (including any limitation or exclusion of liability) is found invalid, unfair or unenforceable under applicable consumer protection law, the remainder remains in force and, where a term would be valid with a modification, it shall apply with the minimum modification necessary to make it valid.

## 1. License Grant

Subject to this EULA, Licensor grants you a personal, non-exclusive, revocable license to install and use the Software on devices you own or control for personal and commercial purposes, and—subject to Section 3—to make and distribute copies as permitted therein.

## 2. Ownership

The Software is licensed, not sold. Sergei Panfilov and its licensors retain all title and IP rights. **Third-party components** are licensed under their respective terms.

## 3. Permitted Use, Sharing & Reverse Engineering

You may:

- install and use the Software on devices you own or control;
- make personal backup copies for your own use;
- reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, analyze and modify the Software to the extent permitted by applicable law **and** for interoperability, modding and educational purposes;
- share **unmodified** copies of the Software **free of charge** with other individuals, provided that you include this EULA, do not hold us responsible for any issues arising from such sharing, and only where this is not prohibited by applicable law or the terms of the relevant Distribution Channel.
- distribute or resell the Software commercially **as an unofficial build**, provided that you (i) clearly and prominently state that your distribution is **unofficial and not endorsed** by us, (ii) do **not** use our trademarks, logos or branding beyond nominative fair use, (iii) include this EULA and all third-party notices, (iv) do not modify or bundle the Software with malware, adware, or telemetry, and (v) only where this is not prohibited by applicable law or the terms of the relevant Distribution Channel.

You must **not:**

- create, market, distribute or use **cheats, hacks, bots, aimbots, trainers, exploits** or other tools intended to gain an unfair advantage, disrupt operation or user experience, bypass anti-cheat, or compromise the integrity or security of the Software or others’ systems;
- develop, embed or distribute **malware** or use the Software as a vehicle for malicious code, phishing, or fraud;
- **impersonate** us or **mislead** users by presenting your builds as “official”, using confusingly similar names, or implying sponsorship, endorsement, or partnership without our prior written permission;
- violate applicable law or third-party rights when using, modifying, or sharing the Software.

We do **not** provide support, tools, or compatibility commitments for reverse engineering, modifications, or shared copies. Updates may break mods or unofficial builds, and we are **not liable** for any resulting loss or damage. Nothing in this section grants rights to our trademarks or proprietary assets beyond what is necessary for interoperability and nominative fair use.

Any distribution under this Section 3 is at your sole responsibility and expense. You act as the seller/distributor for legal purposes, and we provide no warranties, support, or obligations to your recipients.

## 4. Modding / Extensions

You may create, use, and distribute mods for the Software **at your own risk**, provided that your mods:

- comply with applicable law and **do not infringe** third-party rights;
- **do not harm** security, performance, or integrity of the Software or others’ systems;
- do **not** circumvent technical protection measures or unlawfully access proprietary assets.

We **do not** provide support, tools, or compatibility commitments for mods. Updates may break mods, and we are **not liable** for any loss or damage arising from mods. We may restrict or disable mods in online/competitive modes or where required for legal, safety, anti-cheat, or compliance reasons.

You retain rights in your mods. This EULA does **not** grant rights to our IP beyond what is necessary to interoperate with the Software.

## 5. Updates

The Software may receive updates, patches, bug fixes, or content changes (“Updates”). Updates may be delivered through any Distribution Channels in use from time to time, including automatic updates where supported, or by including updated files in the distribution package. Some Updates may be required to continue use.

Where provided, release notes/advisories may be delivered within the product, in the update package, or via the applicable Distribution Channel. No specific location or cadence is guaranteed.

We do **not** commit to service levels, availability targets, or ongoing support unless expressly agreed in a separate written agreement.

**Security support period.** The security support period for the Software is defined in the **Support Period Policy** included with the product (`SUPPORT.md`).

## 6. Third-Party Services

Purchasing, downloading, installation, account, or entitlement functions may be provided by your chosen Distribution Channels and are subject to their own terms and privacy policies. Any online features of the Software (if offered) may rely on third-party services under their respective terms.

## 7. User-Generated Content (if applicable)

Where UGC features exist for the Software, you remain responsible for your content. You grant Licensor a **worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free** license to use, reproduce, display, and adapt UGC for operating and promoting the Software. Licensor may remove content that violates this EULA or the law.

## 8. Children & Age Ratings

This Software is not directed to children below the age requiring parental consent under applicable law (e.g., EU 16, US 13, China 14). We do not knowingly collect personal data from such children.

## 9. Accessibility

Where required by applicable law (e.g., the **EU Accessibility Act**), we aim to address **accessibility feedback** for consumer-facing builds **within reasonable and proportionate limits**. Contact: **pnf036+anarchy@gmail.com**. This section does **not** create service levels or guarantees.

## 10. Term & Termination

This EULA is effective until terminated. It terminates automatically if you materially breach it. Upon termination, cease use and uninstall the Software. Sections intended to survive (Ownership, Third-Party Components, Disclaimers, Liability, Governing Law) shall survive.

## 11. Disclaimer of Warranties

The Software is provided **“AS IS”**, **to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law**, without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including **merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement**. **Statutory consumer rights are not affected.**

## 12. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, Licensor shall **not** be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages.

**Nothing in this EULA excludes or limits liability where such exclusion or limitation is unlawful (including for death or personal injury, fraud, or wilful misconduct).**

## 12A. Liability Cap (Business Users Only)

This clause applies **only** to Business Users. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Licensor’s aggregate liability for all claims relating to the Software shall not exceed **the total fees paid by that Business User to the Licensor for the Software in the 12 months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim**.

This clause does not apply to Consumers and does not limit liability where such limitation is unlawful.

## 13. Export Controls & Sanctions

You must comply with applicable **export, re-export, and sanctions** laws. You may not use or transfer the Software to restricted persons, entities, destinations, or for prohibited end uses.

## 14. Third-Party Components (License Precedence)

The Software includes **third-party components**. **To the extent of any conflict between this EULA and the license terms of a third-party component, the third-party license controls for that component.** Third-party notices and licenses are provided in the distribution package (see `NOTICE` and `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES`).

## 15. Governing Law & Consumer Rights

This EULA is governed by the laws of **The Netherlands** with venue in **Amsterdam**.

If you are a Consumer, **mandatory consumer protection laws of your country of residence remain applicable**.

## 16. Changes

We may update this EULA. Material changes may be communicated **within the product or the update package** (e.g., in-product notice, prompt to review the EULA on update, or release notes included with the distribution), or via the applicable Distribution Channel. Continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance.

## Governing Language

This agreement is drafted in English. Translations may be provided for convenience. In consumer markets where local-language versions are required by law for clarity and fairness, the local-language version controls to the extent required by applicable law; otherwise, the English version controls.
